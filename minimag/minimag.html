    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>Every once in a while comes a video game that claims - or is claimed - to 'revolutionize' its genre, to bring it beyond what it used to be, or to 'evolve' it, defining a new step along the generic road it is treading.[1] As a case in point, Aki Järvinen's (2002) review of Halo (Bungie Software 2001) boldly states that with this release, "the FPS is dead. Long live the new FPS!" With Halo, Järvinen says, came a new generation of First-Person Shooters; he even likens the game's arrival to a meteorite crashing on "Planet First-Person Shooter", causing the extinction of prior life ("Quakesauruses") and paving the way for, metaphorically, the rise of the next life-form. One could not ask for a better textbook statement for showing that the idea that genres 'evolve' akin to biological species is second nature to the discourse of most knowledgeable gamers, gaming press people, industry veterans and game studies academics. Innovation in video game genre is consequently understood as either exploring radically new ground by creating a new genre, or refining current mechanics up one notch and taking an existing genre to a new age.</p>
