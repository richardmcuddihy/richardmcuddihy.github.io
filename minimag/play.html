      <h1 class="w3-text-orange">Consoles</h1>
      <p class="color">Games are usually played on hardware developed by different gaming and technological industries such as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. These 3 are the top tier companys that create the famous gaming consoles we use today. The name for the current consoles being used now are the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and the Wii U. These consoles have the latest in next gen software and can handle a high amount of frames and graphics that previous versions of the console couldnt come close too. With the Ps4 being what I believe to be the most popular comes with many features that can connect your phone or smart device too it through bluetooth connection. The Xbox one is another huge console that rivals the Ps4 in graphics and interface, the xbox 360 which is the older version was the first of its kind to have a motion sensing game using a camera that followed the players movement, of course Playstation tried the same but it didnt compare as well as xbox. The last of the popular consoles is the Wii U, which isnt as popular as the other two unfortunately, the use for it now is to play nintendos very popular series of games such as Mario, Pokemon, and a universal favorite Super Smash Brothers. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-yellow">PC gaming</h1>
      <p class="color">For those who dont enjoy having the physical enjoyment of having a console that seperate from the others, PC gaming is the way to go. With a gaming software called Steam players are able to download an even bigger variety of games on their computer that include almost all and every game from all consoles into one. The benefits of being a PC gamer is not having to worry about not being able to play with friends that have a different console than you. The only difference for PC gaming is having to supply yourself with the necessary hardware to run games on your computer. But as for as variety, theres much more to have when playing on PC.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-red">Handhelds</h1>
      <p class="color">Not as popular as Consoles or PCs but a lot more convenient, this is the positive of handheld games. Handhelds are miniature versions of certain consoles, such as the Nintendo 3DS or the PS vita, these supply gamers with small pocketsized controllers that allow them to play games outside or on the go. The variety of games are limited and they arent supplied with the best of graphics or compare to the playing style as the more heavier stuff, but it allows people to travel and keep the worry away of carrying a computer or even bigger device around with them.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Virtual Reality</h1>
      <p class="color">The next in gaming history is VR, short for (Virtual Reality) VR games are the latest in next gen systems for gaming. VR games bring the player even deeper inside a game then ever before. You are given a headset that comes on as a pair of goggles, along with two controllers for each hand, and a camera to catch ones movements. The latest in VR gear are the Oculus Rift, Playstation VR, Gear VR and the HTC vive. With the Oculus Rift and the HTC vive being the most popular platforms to play VR games on, they are dominating the virtual world of gaming. To be able to enter a game as yourself and be in the eyes of your character is every gamer nerds dream. With more and more VR games being released, the next generation of gaming couldnt be more close.</p>
